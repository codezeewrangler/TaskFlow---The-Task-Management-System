# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute!

- Fork the repo and create a topic branch for your change.
- Keep changes small and include tests if applicable.
- Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
mvn -f /Users/yashovardhantiwari/Documents/Projects/taskmanager/pom.xml package
```

- Do not add secrets to the repo. Use `application.properties.example` as a template.
- Write clear commit messages and reference issues in PR descriptions.
- We'll review PRs and merge when ready.
